# COVID-19 KGE drug repurposing

1. Unzip `project_data.zip` from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oIB6T4Hc3bHaKEjCP89K8WwbZCREuPmR/view?usp=sharing in order to get necessary data to run code. Make sure files are extracted to the same directory that `drug_repurposing.ipynb` resides in.
2. Move `RotatE_drkg_0` into `embed` directory _after_ inflating the tarball of DRKG data using the code in `drug_repurposing.ipynb`.
